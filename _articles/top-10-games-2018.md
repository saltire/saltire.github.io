### BELOW

Slipped in just before the deadline, so haven’t gotten too far yet, but pretty immersive.
Also frustrating at points, but that's the nature of roguelikes, I guess! We're spoiled these days.

Does a really good job of presenting UI and mechanics with very little explanatory text.
Looks fantastic and yet also oddly retro, with a kind of Little Big Adventure vibe.


### Russian Subway Dogs

Fun as hell, addictive, and takes a surprising amount of finesse.
Super cute concept and well-executed:
you're a stray dog startling people in train stations and shamelessly sniping their food.
Background art really captures the absurdly ornate Moscow subway system.
Characters are adorable and include a bunch of shout-outs to other Toronto-developed games.
The difficulty ramps up pretty quickly but you sometimes find yourself making incredible combos,
which always feels great. Simple and slick.


### RUINER

This game is all about style, and pulls it off well despite the well-worn cyberpunk territory:
ultra-saturated lighting, comic-style character illustrations that fit in surprisingly nicely,
and a badass, POUNDING techno soundtrack.
Fast, fast, fast, ultra-violent gameplay with a pretty good selection of weapons,
and a skill tree with lots of options.
Felt a bit button-mashy at first, but once I figured out a build I liked,
I got in a pretty good groove.

Gotta say it was a pleasure [turning all my lights red](/articles/neopixeldesk),
cranking the volume, and immersing myself in some frenzied slaughter.


### Guacamelee! 2

I only just played the first game in this series this year as well.
What I love about this game is how it makes you use the entire controller;
you have a large number of moves that you often have to use a lot of in quick succession.
This makes for some really demanding arena battles and jumping puzzles,
though to be honest I was hoping for more.
It also lacks the challenge area of the original for some reason.
Otherwise though, a great update, with more interesting level design
and somehow even MORE detailed and colourful art than before.
Oh, and most importantly, VASTLY IMPROVED CHICKEN MECHANICS!


### Return of the Obra Dinn

It's nice to have a fresh, different type of game.
This is a detective story with logic-puzzle gameplay that I really enjoyed.
Surprising story told through stills and voice-acting; gets dark REALLY quickly.
Cool aesthetic and environments; plus, it's nautical-themed, which always gets points from me.


### Minit

This seemed to me like an instant classic, due to its one central, defining game mechanic
and really stripped-down production.
It's a clever little scavenger hunt with wacky character art and fun, catchy music.
Also short and sweet; totally built for speedrunning.


### Ghost of a Tale

This is a beautiful medieval RPG where you play a minstrel mouse,
sneaking around a castle keep filled with vicious guard rats.
The graphics are AAA quality and the characters are really cute.
The gameplay is mostly stealth, without any real combat on your part (you're a mouse, after all),
but it still manages to be exciting and have some pretty spectacular scenes.

But the most surprising thing was how rich and detailed a world I found myself in.
The game takes place in a single, gradually expanding, unbroken map that gets pretty large,
but which you'll know like the back of your hand by the end.
There are plenty of well-developed characters, and a lot of story and history to discover
in your interactions with them and the world.

Impressively, Ghost of a Tale was developed largely by a single person,
and it seems like there's plenty of room for a sequel, so I'll certainly be waiting for that.


### Into the Breach

I really put a lot of time into this one.
Piloting huge mechs to defend the earth against giant alien bugs is a pretty badass concept.
Gameplay is like chess combined with the really painstaking grid-based tactics of, say,
4th edition D&D.
The time travel theme of this game adds one key mechanic:
the ability to see exactly what the enemy will do on its next turn.
This leaves a lot less to chance and lets you put a lot more planning into every move.
It also requires a whole lot of UI, which apparently took up the majority of the developers' time.
Pays off, though: the gameplay is really nuanced and you can pull off a surprising amount of
strategy for being packed into such a cramped little grid.

Visually the game inherits a lot from *FTL*, Subset's previous game.
It's maybe not quite as hard (though certainly still challenging),
but it has the same kind of replay value: lots of mech squads with totally different play styles,
and plenty of achievements and stretch goals.
I've played it through to the end at least a dozen times.

The soundtrack by Ben Prunty is tight and focused and really boosts the tension.
Nice pixel art character portraits too – for both the human resistance and our new insect overlords.


### EXAPUNKS

Everything by Zachtronics is extremely my shit.
If *Opus Magnum* had been released a month later, it would also be high up on this list.
*EXAPUNKS* has all the same stuff I liked about Opus, *TIS-100*, *SpaceChem*, etc.,
but the slick retro 90s hacker underground aesthetic is really badass.
Minigames break up the intense brain-racking of the core puzzles.

In a lot of ways it’s the same type of game as Opus Magnum:
increasingly challenging puzzles punctuated by some lighter minigames and an unfolding story.
But the alternate 90’s hacker underground aesthetic is real nice,
and there’s just more of everything: story told through multiple parallel channels,
more minigames, unique backdrops for each puzzle,
competitive levels that put you head-to-head with other players,
and a sandbox for creating your own minigames.

Having an in-universe underground zine (complete with printable PDF) serve as the instruction manual
is just genius, especially when you see the authentically awful 90's-era graphic design.

Plus, another solid soundtrack that works great as focus music for real hacking too.


### Celeste

Gonna have to side with the critics on this one: it is all around the best game I played all year.
Bright and colourful, every level has its own look, feel, sound, and gameplay style.

The story is undeniably good, with a central theme that a lot of people can relate to.

Some extremely hard jumping puzzles. And in a sadistic little touch, it keeps track of the number of deaths on each level. Which for me, often numbered well into the thousands.
Really kickass score that really goes a lot of places,
but keeps a recurring theme that really ties it all together.

Nice touch that each level has a "B-side" with a harder set of screens,
the soundtrack for each level mirrors that with its own "B-side" remix.
(Now imagine my eyes widening as I beat the B-side levels,
only to discover an even more punishing "C-side" after each one.)


The sprites and background art are also really solid, and the game is just


## Honorable mentions


### Beat Saber

Only good rhythm game I’ve played in VR so far. Looks fantastic, and like most rhythm games, it’s got dead simple gameplay and a practically infinite range of difficulty. The included tunes are great for the game, but not anything you’d catch me listening to outside of it.
There are a couple of unofficial level editors, and plugins for finding homemade levels; while they vary in quality, it’s great that the door is open to playing with more familiar tunes. I’m sure if they release official, community-based versions of these, the experience will only get better.


### Deltarune

### Dead Cells

I had this game very early in its Early Access phase, and it was my #1 favourite game of 2017,
which is why I didn't put this on the list.
But I didn’t make a list last year and it had its 1.0 release in 2018, so I’ll still mention it.
It fucking rules and I've put a lot of hours into it.
It's just the fast-twitch hack-and-slash gameplay that I love, it looks and sounds beautiful,
and it's pure dopamine when you get a good build together and really tear your way through.


### No Man’s Sky Next

No Man’s Sky has been out a couple years now, but I think for many people, the Next update is where it really started to deliver on its initial promise, so let’s throw it in. It’s certainly when I started throwing some serious hours into this game. There’s still lots of room to improve, but I’ve got to salute Hello Games for putting in the work, especially in the face of all the shit they’ve probably taken from people since they first launched. It’s the most beautiful game I’ve ever seen, and there really is nothing like having your own little ship that you can fly anywhere in the galaxy you want, whenever you want.


### The Messenger

Shameless throwback to Ninja Gaiden that really sticks to the NES aethetic.
Controls are really tight and level design has its challenging moments,
though a lot of the time it just feels like going through the motions.
It's got some really nice touches though, particularly the NPCs:
the shopkeeper and the demon are clever to the point of being infuriating.


### Sunless Sea
