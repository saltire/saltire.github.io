In 2014 I did an art exhibition with longtime friend and prolific comic illustrator 
[Zen Rankin](https://www.zenrankin.com), titled **Hard Livin'**.

It was a "room-sized board game," filling the walls of 
[Hashtag Gallery](https://www.hashtaggallery.com) in Toronto with 
500 unique, hand-painted wooden squares.

Managing all of these pieces and arranging them in a specific order was a logistical nightmare,
so I wrote this little drag-and-drop UI to help us prototype the game.

I also made a couple little toys using the pieces, like a memory game,
and a window display on the same LED matrix panel I used in
[jumbotron](/articles/jumbotron).
