An organization tool for an art exhibition I did in 2014 with my friend Zen Rankin.
This required the arrangement of 500 painted pieces of a room-sized board game.
Managing all of these pieces and arranging them in a specific order was a logistical nightmare,
so I wrote this little UI to help us prototype the game.

I also made a couple little toys using the pieces, like a memory game,
and a connection to the LED matrix panel I used in
[jumbotron](/articles/saltires-github/jumbotron).

*Languages:* Python, Javascript, Arduino

*Future plans:* Create more interesting games with the tiles, either browser-based or actual cards.
