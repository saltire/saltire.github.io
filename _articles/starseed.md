[Starseed Pilgrim](http://starseedpilgrim.com) is a game that involves growing colourful,
tree-like structures in unpredictable ways. Fun and highly recommended, by the way!

You can only see a small area of the world at any given time,
and after a while I wanted to see the big picture.
Being a small game, there wasn't any existing utility that I could find for this, so I wrote my own.
Required a bit of reverse engineering of the save file, and yielded some pretty little maps
of the coloured blocks I grew over the course of my game.

Also helped me cheat, of course.

**Spoiler alert**: maybe don't check out my rendered maps until after you've played the game!

*Languages:* Python

*Future plans:* This was a pretty quick one-off. But I'd love to try this with other games.
I did a quick one for [Terraria](/articles/saltires-github/terramap) at one point,
and a much more extensive one for [Minecraft](/articles/saltires-github/cmapbash).
Who knows... Dwarf Fortress, maybe?
