Yet another map generator! This one for Terraria.
I actually just looked while writing this, and the readme says it doesn't support colours,
but there are a bunch of uncommitted changes and some brightly-coloured sample images
from about a year and a half ago. Guess I'll commit those... better late than never!

This is the first GitHub repo for which I ever received a pull request,
and it came out of the blue. That was nice. Social coding!

*Languages:* Python

*Future plans:* An obvious upgrade for this app would be to get it working with Starbound.
Possible? No idea... I'll have to find out!
